        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This pasta dough recipe is consistently great and easy to make.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups flour</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a bowl until combined. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to flour mixture until a smooth, thick dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 8 balls; use a pasta machine to roll and cut dough into desired pasta shape.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
        <p>This dough makes really great homemade linguine or ravioli using a manual pasta machine. If it's too sticky, just roll a bit in flour.</p>
        <p>This recipe makes enough pasta for 24 small raviolis or 4 servings of linguine. Whatever pasta you make, it should take no more than 4 to 6 minutes to boil.</p>
